# Discord_Bot_Text_Reverser
Simple bot that takes discord commands

I'll add to this readme later with instructions and a complete list of requirements.  

You can create a new bot user at: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
You will need to create your own bot user to bring your own version of this bot online.

My bot:
